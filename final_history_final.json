Before I could initiate a traffic stop on the suspect, the motorcycle accelerated to 150 miles per hour in a 60 miles per hour zone. I broadcast the information over the radio and attempted to catch up to the suspect by activating my emergency lights and sirens. The suspect, later identified as Kyle Mellor, continued west on Interstate 40 West while crossing over all lanes of traffic at high rates of speed. As the motorcycle approached the JFK exit in North Little Rock, Sgt. Keri Permenter intercepted the fleeing motorcycle and attempted to stop it by activating her emergency lights and sirens. The vehicle continued fleeing and exited Interstate 40 at mile marker 152."
