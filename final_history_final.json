The winter storm just made a CATASTROPHIC track shift in the last 6 hours that has completely rewritten the forecast and 82 major cities are now facing blizzard emergencies as this beast takes aim at the most populated corridor in America! What was forecast to stay offshore and bring manageable impacts has suddenly SHIFTED inland putting the heaviest snow, strongest winds, and most dangerous conditions directly over major metropolitan areas from Washington DC all the way to Boston and beyond. This CATASTROPHIC shift happened because the upper-level low dug further south than models predicted, a secondary low formed exactly where forecasters feared it would, and the phasing between multiple energy sources created explosive intensification right along the coast - we're talking about snowfall totals JUMPING from 6-12 inches to potentially 24-36+ inches in cities that thought they'd dodge this bullet just yesterday! The 82 cities now under blizzard emergencies include New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, DC, and dozens more with a combined population exceeding 60 MILLION people about to experience CATASTROPHIC winter weather conditions with life-threatening blizzard whiteouts, coastal flooding, and complete travel shutdowns!.Catastrophic track shift explained - what changed in last 6 hours"
